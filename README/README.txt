Project Information
This project was created in order to create a Sky web/splash page to promote the newly revamped Sky 
Cinema offer. The web-page design is marvel themed and incorporates futuristic elements.The web-page also enables the user to light up various objects by using specified keys on the keyboard.

Features
To build the web page everything from design, layout colours to functions were specifically chosen to 
produce a page that emulates a cinematic experience. A dark background was used to coincide with the 
cinema theme. Due to the project being a design similar to J.A.R.V.I.S an Interface named ULTRA and 
map was included with system information. Spiderman was also used as part of the background as the 
new Spider that is yet to be released will have a suit designed by Tony Stark. A video was also included 
on the web page which is a trailer for the new Avengers "End Game" film being released in April 2019 which 
opens out when the mouse hovers over it.  The web page has three separate images of Marvel 
villains Thanos, Venom, Black Panther.
A transparent effect was given throughout the development of the page to give softer feel to the page 
than solid features.  A file system was also included with the following categories; Files, system, Project, 
Computer.
